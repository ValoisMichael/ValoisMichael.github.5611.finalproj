# "Maze of the Minotaur King"

This repo contains my final project for 5611:
* [My PDF Report of the Final Project Writeup](https://github.com/ValoisMichael/ValoisMichael.github.5611.finalproj/files/13710598/5611.Final.Project.Written.Report.pdf)
* All source code
* A build of the Game

For the build of the game, the controls are WASD for movement and Esc for quiting out.
I hope you enjoy!
